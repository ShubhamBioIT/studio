## üìù About The Project

LabLink AI is a modern, web-based application designed to streamline lab management for research teams. It replaces scattered spreadsheets and notebooks with a centralized, intelligent system. With features like sample tracking, project management, and a powerful AI assistant, LabLink helps researchers save time, reduce errors, and focus on what matters most: **discovery**.

This application was built using a modern tech stack to provide a fast, responsive, and feature-rich user experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
*   npm
    ```sh
    npm install npm@latest -g
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/lablink-ai.git
    cd lablink-ai
    ```
2.  **Install NPM packages**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up your environment variables**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Firebase project configuration:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
    ```
4.  **Run the development server**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## üî• Firebase Configuration

This project requires a Firebase project to function correctly.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project**: Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Create a Web App**: Inside your project, create a new Web App and copy the `firebaseConfig` object values into your `.env.local` file.
3.  **Enable Authentication**:
    -   Go to the **Authentication** section.
    -   Under the **Sign-in method** tab, enable the **Email/Password** and **Anonymous** providers.
4.  **Set up Firestore**:
    -   Go to the **Firestore Database** section and create a new database in production mode.
    -   Navigate to the **Rules** tab and paste the following rules. This allows any authenticated user to read all data, but only create, update, or delete their own documents.
    ```firestore-rules
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        // Allow users to read/write their own user document
        match /users/{userId} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
        }

        // Shared collections with ownership rules
        match /{collection}/{docId} {
          allow read: if request.auth != null;
          allow create: if request.auth != null 
                        && request.resource.data.createdBy.uid == request.auth.uid;
          allow update, delete: if request.auth != null 
                                && resource.data.createdBy.uid == request.auth.uid;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    *Note: The generic `/{collection}/{docId}` rule will cover `samples`, `projects`, and `workflows` as long as they contain a `createdBy.uid` field matching the authenticated user.*
5.  **Set up Storage**:
    -   Go to the **Storage** section and click "Get Started" to enable it.
    -   Navigate to the **Rules** tab and update your rules to allow authenticated users to read and write files. A secure starting point is:
    ```firestore-rules
    rules_version = '2';
    service firebase.storage {
      match /b/{bucket}/o {
        // Only allow authenticated users to read and write to storage
        match /{allPaths=**} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
